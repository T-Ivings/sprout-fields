[![No Maintenance Intended](http://unmaintained.tech/badge.svg)](http://unmaintained.tech/)

The plugin will be lightly maintained on Craft 3 if critical issues arise as long as our Craft 3 commercial plugins are supported. However, we recommend not using Sprout Fields for new projects.

As Craft has added several of these fields, in an effort to reduce the number of packages we publicly maintain, Sprout Fields will not be migrated to Craft 4. Feel free to fork and use any code in this repository for a custom plugin or module.
